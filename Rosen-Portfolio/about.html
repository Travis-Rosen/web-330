            <p>Hello! Welcome to my personal portfolio. My name is Travis Rosen. Currently, I am 23 years of age studying to become a web developer at Bellevue University. I have an eagerness to learn and grow as a developer paired with an unmeasurable work ethic.  </p>

        <div class="timeline">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <time>2015</time> At this time, my entire life centered around soccer. I was a senior in highschool who had committed to play at Xavier University, a top NCAA Division I program. It was exhilarating that I was following my dreams to play at the highest levels. 
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <time>2016</time> I completed a year with Xavier University, but ultimately those dreams quickly fizzled out of my grasp. It felt that the competition was too out of reach for me, and mentally I gave up. It was devastating to watch my dreams slowly dissipate.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <time>2017</time> That following year, I transferred to Texas A&M University to study Sports Management. I was still void of motivation because it felt as if everything I had built towards growing up, was swept out from my feet. In hindsight, I had no interest in Sports Management and I chose it as an easy way out. 
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <time>2017-2018</time> During this time, I found happiness in friends and family, but still lacked motivation to better my future. I continued to go through the motions, just following the unwanted path I had chosen. I persuaded myself that eventually I would enjoy what I was studying and find that powerful motivation and work ethic I used to live by. 
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <time>2019</time> This was the year where everything changed for me. I gained the strength to look into the mirror and realize I was the one choosing to push down the old version of myself. Just because one dream was lost, does not mean I cannot sculpt new ones with my own hands. So that is exactly what I did. I left A&M that very day, and built a plan to build the future I wanted. 
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <time>2020</time> I had little experience with web development, but for some reason I was extremely drawn to it. For a few months I played around with free coding classes and watched videos, and even though it was at an extremely simple scale, I thoroughly enjoyed it. A familiar burning passion began to ignite, and I wanted to compete again. Only this time, it would be different. I wanted to become a fantastic web developer and create things that cause positive impacts. I would not allow myself to give up this time around, regardless of the difficulties I would face. 
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>
                        <time>2021-Present</time> I decided to take the route of gaining a web development degree. While I was making steady progress through self-teaching, I wanted to further my education at a higher scale. While I still consider myself a small cub amongst the bears of the development community, I have so much confidence in my future. I am furthering my education and understanding of web development at an extremely fast pace. With the combination of my ever growing knowledge, my relentless work-ethic, and my refined motivation, I know I can become a fantastic Web Developer.
